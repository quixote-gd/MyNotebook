## Purpose
The purpose of this sample project is to analyze clean architecture. I want to understand how the dependancies work and why this pattern makes a project framework dependent. 

The project's end goal is to save an web article's text and allow a user to persist highlights and take notes (pretty much pocket).


## Get Started
Create your key ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"


ssh-add yourkey for windows you might need to start up the ssh-agent with
the eval $(ssh-agent -s) command beforehand. If this seems continual then
take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18404272/running-ssh-agent-when-starting-git-bash-on-windows

Take your public key and add it to the ssh keys in your gitlab profile.
